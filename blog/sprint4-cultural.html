          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
          <p>
            you haven't passed YET - you might be wrong but you wont always be!!
            seems like if you encourage learning over just being right people
            will learn more & better
          </p>

          </h3>
          <p>
            Not particularly , choosing learning instead of trying to just be
            right all the time seems like the right way to go
          </p>
          <h3>
            How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Not let failure get me down. Yes im wrong now, but i wont alway be!
            Fantastic for spending hours tryna figure out a bug!
