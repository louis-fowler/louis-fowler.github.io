            >Long term career goal is to work full time as dev. Front end is
            what I enjoy the most at the moment so probably something in that
            field. As this course goes on I hope i can find other avenues of
            programing I enjoy. I have done a bit of freelance before and
            although I did enjoy it working from home got to distracting and
            constantly looking for my next job got lame pretty quick. So I think
            a job in an office around other people would be ideal.</p

            dev work as a freelancer working in a co-operative environment would
            be a very nice change</p

            "I've never heard of css flex and grid before, lets jump down that
            rabbit hole" This can also be a bit of a limitation though, as often
            those rabbit hole jumps distract from the work I'm meant to be
            doing</p

            >I have to be very strict with myself. Set a day start time and
            finish time. Only let myself have breaks when i've pre-arranged
            (pomodoro). I think with the use of tools like slack and github
            working with others will not be a problem, If anything im excited
            about the idea :)</p

          <p
            >I generally have no problem asking questions. If you don't know the
            answer to a question theres no embarrassment in trying to learn. So
            asking Joe or other facilitators questions is fine with me. I'm also
            lucky to have supportive friends who work in the industry that are
            happy to help me</p

            >Support and guidance. I expect to be taught new ideas then
            supported if i don't understand. I expect to feel comfortable asking
            questions. I expect to make some new friends :)
