          <h3>
            What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your
            ego as a result of the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            That I don't to enforce work hours for programming because I enjoy
            it so much. I would constantly look forward to 'getting to work' the
            next day.I'm very good at loosing myself down rabbit holes, I will
            spend hours trying to sort something small out if I know I can. That
            leads to the third thing - I find it very hard to admit defeat, if I
            get lost and I've used up all available learning avenues (google,
            asking for help) I still cant move on until its perfect.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Empathy and self awareness are very important, as shown in the last
            point in the previous question. If I had better self awareness and
            empathy towards myself I could move on. Often moving on and coming
            back later works things out!
          </p>
          <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            How much of it I was already aware of - Mindfulness has been a core
            part of my life for a long time!
          </p>
          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            I guess the looping things. Talking to a stranger (soon to be
            friend) for two minutes straight was weird. Listening was even
            weirder!
          </p>
          <h3>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Its a part of the learning process. If you want to work in the
            programming industry theres more you need to learn than just
            programming.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
            waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing
            programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </h3>
          <p>
            No, I understand where yall are coming from. Nowadays the computer
            dev isn't some person locked in a room, only allowed out once
            they've finished their job. YOu have to know how to interact with
            others if you want to be successful in this industry
