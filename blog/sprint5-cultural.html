          <h3>
            What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your
            ego as a result of the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            That I don't to enforce work hours for programming because I enjoy
            it so much. I would constantly look forward to 'getting to work' the
            next day.I'm very good at loosing myself down rabbit holes, I will
            spend hours trying to sort something small out if I know I can. That
            leads to the third thing - I find it very hard to admit defeat, if I
            get lost and I've used up all available learning avenues (google,
            asking for help) I still cant move on until its perfect.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Empathy and self awareness are very important, as shown in the last
            point in the previous question. If I had better self awareness and
            empathy towards myself I could move on. Often moving on and coming
            back later works things out!
          </p>
          <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            How much of it I was already aware of - Mindfulness has been a core
            part of my life for a long time!
          </p>
          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            I guess the looping things. Talking to a stranger (soon to be
            friend) for two minutes straight was weird. Listening was even
            weirder!
          </p>
          <h3>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Its a part of the learning process. If you want to work in the
            programming industry theres more you need to learn than just
            programming.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
            waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing
            programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </h3>
          <p>
            No, I understand where yall are coming from. Nowadays the computer
            dev isn't some person locked in a room, only allowed out once
            they've finished their job. YOu have to know how to interact with
            others if you want to be successful in this industry

          <h2>Reflect on your learning</h2>
          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            My long term goal will be to find a career in the programming
            industry and to work my way up from there. I would hope to work in
            an environment where I can learn but also do my own thing. I have
            always thought I would prefer working in a workplace setting but
            this lockdown has got me enjoying programming from home again - with
            no distractions!
          </p>
          <h3>
            hat do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
            Bootcamp?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think my biggest strength is my passion for learning and helping
            others where I can. I feel that asking questions is important and
            trying to answer them even if you're not to sure. I've realised over
            the foundation period that one of my biggest limitations is not
            being able to let things go. I will get something working great but
            then spend 10 more hours making it perfect when it doesn't need to
            be. Get it working well, move on, come back if need be
          </p>
          <h3>
            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
            will be?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think that showing people my work will be the hardest part.
            spending hours/days on something then showing someone my work for
            critiquing will be nerve racking. What if its not good enough? what
            if its bug filled etc etc. what if it isn't PERFECT. Even work that
            I've worked on with others. What will others think of it...
          </p>
          <h3>
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at EDA?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think working on my feelings towards the answer above. Work on
            giving and receiving feedback. I also think developing leadership
            skills is important, as freelance work in teh industry can be quite
            lucrative. To be good at it you have to have drive and ability to
            work with clients one on one. Those skills would be important to
            learn.
          </p>
          <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
          <p>
            Be collaborative - make sure that the alone time programming is
            mixed up with group programming. Be social. Make sure to realise the
            context of the environment. It will be stressful. Manage that
            stress. Be excited to ask for help, I will be surrounded by people
            who know things I don't, so use it!
