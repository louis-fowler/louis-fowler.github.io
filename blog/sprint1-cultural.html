            >Reporting bullying in the workplace. It was a pretty difficult
            decision to make. On the one hand it was completely unacceptable to
            way I was being treated, nobody should have to put up with that sort
            of shit. On the other hand I don't want to get anyone fired and I
            don't want to look like a nark and be removed from the colleges
            friend group. Also, the person who was being an asshole was a close
            friend before. This person has a bad temper and cannot handle
            stress. They also have brain trauma. The way they acted was still
            unacceptable and they had to be reported. They were given a warning
            and I avoided that person for a while. I was apologised too. After a
            while I forgave them and was able to rekindle our friendship. They
            have not talked to me like that again. I believe they learned from
            their mistake.</p

            been surrounded by family. Both sides have large families and very
            close with most members. So family is very important to me. My
            family and friends have always been open and excepting of what I
            want to do and who I am. I believe that has become a part of who I
            am as well.

            >I think my biggest strength is my love of learning. I have already
            seen it take over in this first week of the foundations course.
            Every new piece of information was exciting to hear. Even the stuff
            I already knew, being explained in a different way was exciting. It
            will be a perfect fit for the flipped learning classroom. I
            constantly find myself being distracted from my video games/stories
            by googling a solution to a code problem I have, or asking a friend
            for advice. Limitations that worry me at the moment are mainly that
            of motivation and focus. At the moment everything is fine however I
            know how I can get working from home, especially when I get stuck on
            something. (pomodoro has already worked really well for that (if i
            remember to set that bloody timer!))</p

            As i mentioned I think that my love of learning will really help me
            with the flipped classroom form of teaching. Being given resources
            to learn from and expand my skill set is extremely exciting. I think
            this will def help out with focus. As I mentioned before i'm already
            being distracted from normal daily things with programming problems
            because I want to learn how to solve them.

            >With regards to the first question, I have worked with some pretty
            toxic people. So a lot of tension. It may not be they healthiest
            strat but I got to the point where the best option was to just avoid
            them. I had done all I could to try and work around it and it hadn't
            worked out, so avoidance was the only option. It was effective in
            the sense that we were then both able to do our work without the
            distraction of each other. However it broke the team environment ,
            which was stupid. I would probably do the same thing now. If there
            was tension that couldn't be sorted, I would talk to my boss and if
            nothing came of it I would avoid.</p
